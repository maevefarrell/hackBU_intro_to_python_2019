# Basic Data Types
We’ll start off with the three basic data types in Python — ints, floats, and strings.


## Ints
An int (short for integer) is simply any whole number.

**Examples**
* 22
* 0
* -11

## Floats
A float (short for floating point number) is the decimal representation of a number.

**Examples**
* 0.7777
* 2.0
* -3.4342342

Python can do many interesting things with ints and floats. Open up your terminal and type `python` (`python3` if using Mac OS X or Linux). From there, you will see your Python version number and you will be able to enter text. Let’s code!

First, type in `11 + 7` and hit enter. You’ll see that the Python interpreter has replied with 18, which is the result of adding the two numbers together.

### Try out the following examples!
1. What will happen if you do
    1. `8 % 2`
    2. `8 % 7`
    3. `17 / 2`
    4. `17 // 2`
    5. `17 * 2`
    6. 
2. Replace the `?` with the relevant operator to make the equations correct
    1. `9 ? 4 = 1`
    2. `9 ? 2 = 4`
    3. `14 * 3 = 42`
    4. `15 ? 3 = 0`

## Strings
A string is any type of text (can include words, numbers, and other special symbols).

**Examples**
* "hello, world!"
* "1234567890"
* "]!/>;^#$"

There are a lot of interesting operations we can do with strings in our Python interpreter, just like we did with ints and floats. Strings have to be surrounded with double quotes, as shown in the examples above.

*Note: the string "1234567890" is not the same as the int 1234567890.*

### Try out the following examples!
1. `hello + world`
2. `"11" + "7"`
3. `"11" + 7` (Why do you think it's throwing an error message here?)
4. Try concatenating (adding strings together) your first and last name.

## Variables
How do we store information so that we can use it later? This is where variables come in.

**Examples**
* `var = 84`
* `my_string = "cool beans"`
* `int = 23` (Don't panic if you get an error here...)

Once we have our information stored in a variable, we can then manipulate it later on in our code. You have to be careful though, because there are some words that are reserved by Python that you can't use for your variables names. This is because they have other, specific functions. (If you're curious, you can look up "python reserved words" for a list.)

We'll start tinkering with variables when we're writing code to a file instead of using the Python interpreter.
